# Soil Grids analysis
This repo contains code to analyze [soil grids](www.soilgrids.org) data for One Acre Fund use cases in western Kenya. This analysis accesses data from the [Africa SoilGrids](http://data.isric.org/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/home) produced and hosted by ISRIC for the AfSIS project. A big thanks to that team for their support and data!
